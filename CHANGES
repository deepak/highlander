= 0.1.1: 15-Dec-2010
* defined a at_exit hook to close the file locked only if the DATA constant was not provided. 
  otherwise it is the responsibility of the developer 
* calling exit not exit! so that the at_exit handlers are called
* non-zero return status denotes error-condition
* added unit-test to check that locking and at_exit handlers work. it has some warts. check the TODO in the test file
